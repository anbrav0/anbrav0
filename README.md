# Hello there! 👋


My name is Ana and:

🔭 I’m currently working as a Data Scientist at the University of Miami!

🌱 I’m currently learning _alot_ about R and RStudio, reproducibility, and machine learning. 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on advanced statistical programming software with other members in the public health field

🧩 Ask me about Statistics/Public Health/Health disparities 

📚 My interests include substance use disorders, reproducible data and open sourced science.

🔍 My goals are to continue my research in identifying risk factors in Latino/Latinx communities that contributed to the onset of adolescent and young adult substance abuse.
