# Hello there! 👋


My name is Ana and I am currently an MPH student in the Biostatistics concentration at FIU

🔭 I’m currently working with the SUNLab @ FIU as a Senior Research Assistant for the ABCD Study!

🌱 I’m currently learning _alot_ about R and RStudio at the graduate student level 

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on advanced statistical programming software with other members in the public health field

🧩 Ask me about Statistics/Public Health/Health disparities 

📚 My interests include substance use disorders, reproducible data, open sourced science, and machine learning
